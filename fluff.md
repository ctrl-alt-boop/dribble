The key to package organization in this kind of layered structure is to apply the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Also, favor small, focused packages.

Based on your proposed structure, here's what should go into a shared/common module, and why:

### 1. `core` Package (The Shared/Common Module)

This package should be the absolute "lowest common denominator" â€“ it defines the fundamental abstractions that *all* database types (SQL, NoSQL, etc.) will adhere to. It should have **minimal to no external dependencies** (typically just `context` from the standard library).

**What belongs here:**

* **Abstract Query Intent (`core.QueryIntent`):** This is the core data structure that represents *what* the user wants to do, in a database-agnostic way.
    * `struct QueryIntent` (with fields like `OperationType`, `Collection`, `Fields`, `Conditions`, `LimitValue`, `OffsetValue`, etc.)
    * `type OperationType` (enum for `Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Find`, `Aggregate`).
* **Abstract Expression (`core.Expr` Interface):** If your expression builder (`Eq`, `Gt`, `And`) aims to be truly generic across SQL and NoSQL filters, then the `Expr` interface and its base implementations belong here.
    * `type Expr interface { ToIntent() interface{} }`
    * Potentially concrete types like `EqExprIntent`, `GtExprIntent` if `Expr.ToIntent()` returns specific structs.
* **Abstract Execution Interfaces (`core.QueryExecutor`, `core.DMLResult`, `core.QueryResult`):** These define the contract for *how* queries are executed and *what kind of results* are returned, regardless of the underlying database technology.
    * `type QueryExecutor interface { ... }`
    * `type DMLResult interface { ... }`
    * `type QueryResult interface { ... }`
* **Abstract Builder Interface (`core.QueryIntentBuilder`):** An interface that all specific builders (`SQLIntentBuilder`, `MongoFindBuilder`) implement, allowing the `DBClient` to retrieve the generic `QueryIntent`.
    * `type QueryIntentBuilder interface { GetIntent() QueryIntent }`
* **Common Connection Settings (`core.ConnectionSettings`, `core.DriverType`):** If your connection settings contain fields truly common to all database types (like a generic DSN string and a `DriverType` enum), they belong here.
    * `type ConnectionSettings struct { DriverType DriverType; DSN string; /* ... */ }`
    * `type DriverType string` (with constants like `Postgres`, `MongoDB`).

**Why `core` is crucial:** All database-specific modules (`querybuilder`, `nosqlbuilder`) and your top-level client (`db`) will **depend only on `core`'s interfaces and abstract types**. This prevents circular dependencies and allows you to swap out database implementations without affecting the core logic.

### 2. `querybuilder` Package (SQL-Specific Module)

This module handles everything unique to SQL. It **depends on `core`**.

**What belongs here:**

* **SQL Dialect (`querybuilder.Dialect` Interface and Implementations):** This is where your `PostgreSQLDialect`, `MySQLDialect`, `SQLServerDialect`, etc., live. They define how SQL keywords, identifiers, and placeholders are rendered.
* **SQL Renderer (`querybuilder.SQLRenderer`):** This struct takes a `core.QueryIntent` and a `querybuilder.Dialect` to produce a raw SQL string and parameters.
* **SQL Executor (`querybuilder.SQLExecutor`):** This struct implements `core.QueryExecutor`. It uses `*sql.DB` to connect to the database and relies on `SQLRenderer` to get the SQL string from the `QueryIntent`.
* **SQL Intent Builder (`querybuilder.SQLIntentBuilder`):** This is your fluent API for building SQL queries (e.g., `Select().From().Where()`). Its methods populate a `core.QueryIntent`.
* **SQL-specific expression rendering:** If `core.Expr` is truly abstract, the `ToSQL` part of SQL-specific expressions would live here (or in `SQLRenderer`).
* **`querybuilder.ResolveDialect(core.DriverType)` Function:** A function to map a generic `core.DriverType` to a concrete `querybuilder.Dialect`.

**Dependencies:** `querybuilder` depends on `core` (for `QueryIntent`, `Expr`, `QueryExecutor` interface) and `database/sql`. It does *not* depend on the `db` package.

### 3. `db` Package (User-Facing Client Module)

This is the top-level client that users will interact with. It's the "glue" layer. It **depends on `core` and all specific builder/executor modules (like `querybuilder` and future `nosqlbuilder`)**.

**What belongs here:**

* **DB Client (`db.DBClient`):** The main client struct that holds an instance of `core.QueryExecutor`.
* **`db.NewDBClient(settings *core.ConnectionSettings)` Function:** This function is responsible for:
    1.  Receiving the generic `core.ConnectionSettings`.
    2.  Using `settings.DriverType` to determine which specific `core.QueryExecutor` implementation to create (e.g., `querybuilder.NewSQLExecutor`, `nosqlbuilder.NewMongoExecutor`).
    3.  Returning the `db.DBClient` configured with the correct executor.
* **User-Facing Builder Start Methods:** Methods like `(c *DBClient) Select(...) *querybuilder.SQLIntentBuilder` or `(c *DBClient) Find(...) *nosqlbuilder.MongoFindBuilder` that expose the starting points for different query types.
* **User-Facing Execution Methods:** `(c *DBClient) ExecuteQuery(ctx context.Context, builder core.QueryIntentBuilder) (core.QueryResult, error)` which simply pass the `QueryIntent` to the encapsulated `core.QueryExecutor`.

**Dependencies:** `db` depends on `core` (for interfaces and abstract types) and on `querybuilder` (and `nosqlbuilder` in the future) for their concrete implementations of `core.QueryExecutor` and for the specific builder types it returns.

### Summary of Package Responsibilities and Dependencies:

* **`core`**: Defines *what* a query is and *how* it's executed, abstractly. (No external dependencies beyond standard library).
* **`querybuilder`**: Knows *how* to build and execute SQL queries. (Depends on `core`, `database/sql`).
* **`nosqlbuilder` (future)**: Knows *how* to build and execute NoSQL queries. (Depends on `core`, specific NoSQL driver).
* **`db`**: Provides the top-level user API, orchestrating the selection and use of the correct query builder and executor. (Depends on `core`, `querybuilder`, and `nosqlbuilder`).

This architecture creates a highly maintainable, extensible, and future-proof data access layer.
